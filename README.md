# Live-Weather-WebApp
Live Weather Webapp built using HTML-CSS-JS, Integrated with 'OpenWeatherMap API' for database.  
I've used HTML & CSS to give this page an aesthetic appeal to the site,
Used JavaScript to provide functionality and for the integration of OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather forecast database to our site.
I've also tried to make the site such that, on searching for a particular city, the webpage's background image also shows that same city's random photo.
